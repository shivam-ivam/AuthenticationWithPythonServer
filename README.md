# AuthenticationWithPythonServer
This is a practice python project. In which I deal with how to authenticate users at different level using Flask server and flask-login authentication.
## overview
In this project, I have created a small login page on which users have to register themself and if the users have already registered, then they have to login. And then
after the authentication user will get access to the secrets page where they could download a text file. 
## Things that I used 
Well In this project you will find a flask server, have some html templates and css to render the website structure. and for storing user's data, I use sqlalchemy module
to work with SQLite. And for user's authentication session, I use flask_login module.
## Reference
This project was a task for me from a udemy python development course by Dr. Angela Yu.
